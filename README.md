## Overview

TChannel is a networking framing protocol used for general RPC, supporting out-of-order responses at extremely high performance where intermediaries can make a forwarding decision quickly. It is easy to implement in multiple languages, especially JavaScript and Python.

## Design Goals

- Easy implementation in multiple languages
- High performance forwarding path where intermediaries can make forwarding
  decisions quickly
- Request/response model with out-of-order responses so that slow requests don't
  block subsequent faster requests at the head of the line
- Ability of large requests/responses to be broken into fragments and sent
  progressively
- Optional checksums
- Ability to transport multiple protocols between endpoints (e.g., HTTP+JSON
  and Thrift)
